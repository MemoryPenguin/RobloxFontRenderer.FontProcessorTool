# RobloxFontRenderer.FontProcessorTool
A simple font converter for my font renderer (which you can find [here](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/RobloxFontRenderer)).
Use it like this:
```
RbxFontConverter.exe <path_to_ttf> <size1> <size2> <size3>
```

It will create the files in the folder it is located in - this may change later.  You can supply as many sizes (in points) as you want.
